# Chill Zephyr

Chill Zephyr is a web application designed for the big-boned, plus-sized surfing, skating, snowboarding, and extreme sports community. It's a place where body positivity, inclusivity, and diversity are celebrated and international cooperation is encouraged.

## Project Overview

Chill Zephyr is built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. It leverages the power of .NET 6 to provide a rich, interactive, and user-friendly interface. The platform provides an online shop, a blogging section, user profiles, photo and video contests, and a community where users can share their personal experiences.

## Features

1. **Online Shop:** Browse and purchase from our diverse range of sports apparel tailored for people with curves. The sizes follow traditional S, M, L, XL, and XXL labels, but are specially designed for big-boned individuals.

2. **Blog Section:** Read engaging blog posts about surfing, skating, snowboarding, and other extreme sports. Users can also contribute blog posts sharing their experiences and insights.

3. **User Profiles:** Create your own profile, upload photos and videos, and participate in our photo and video contests. Join our vibrant and supportive community and connect with other sports enthusiasts.

4. **Community:** Engage with the Chill Zephyr community, sharing your sports experiences, insights, and achievements. Find encouragement, motivation, and support from like-minded individuals.
